## Vectors in Verilog
Vectors in Verilog are used to represent multi-bit signals, which are crucial when dealing with buses, registers, or large numbers. They allow for grouping multiple bits into a single variable.

A vector is declared by specifying the range of bits using `[MSB:LSB]`, where MSB is the most significant bit and LSB is the least significant bit.
```verilog
wire [3:0] bus;   // 4-bit wide wire (vector)
reg  [7:0] data;  // 8-bit register
```
Individual bits or a range of bits within a vector can be accessed as follows:
```verilog
wire [7:0] data;
assign bit3 = data[3];     // Accessing the 3rd bit of data
assign lower_nibble = data[3:0];  // Accessing the lower 4 bits of data
```

You can assign values directly to vectors:
```verilog
reg [3:0] result;
result = 4'b1010;  // Assigning binary value
result = 4'hA;     // Assigning hexadecimal value
```

A vector can have zero width when the MSB and LSB are the same, meaning it's a single-bit signal:
```verilog
wire [0:0] single_bit;  // Equivalent to a scalar
```

By default, vectors are unsigned, but they can be declared as signed if needed:
```verilog
signed reg [7:0] signed_data;  // Signed 8-bit register
```

In signed vectors, the most significant bit (MSB) is treated as the sign bit.


## Primitives

A Verilog primitive is a pre-defined logic element used in digital designs. These include basic gates like `and`, `or`, `nand`, and `xor`, with fixed functions that don't require module definitions.

**Output Declaration:** In Verilog, when declaring a UDP, the output must always be listed first, followed by the input(s). This order is essential for the proper functioning of the UDP.

**Types of Primitives:**
- **Combinational Primitives:** e.g., `and`, `or`, `xor`
- **Sequential Primitives:** Flip-flops, latches

### User Defined Primitives (UDPs)

UDPs are custom-defined logic, either combinational or sequential, declared using the `primitive` keyword. They use a truth table to define behavior.

- **Example (Combinational UDP):**
    ```verilog
    primitive my_and (out, in1, in2);  
    output out;  
    input in1, in2;  

    // The 'table' defines the behavior of this custom primitive.
    // Each row in the table specifies input combinations and the corresponding output.
    // For an AND gate, the output is 1 only when both inputs are 1.
    table
        0 0 : 0;  // If both inputs are 0, the output is 0.
        1 1 : 1;  // If both inputs are 1, the output is 1.
        // For simplicity, intermediate input states (like 0 1 or 1 0) are not explicitly defined here,
        // but in a full AND gate implementation, these would typically output 0.
    endtable

    endprimitive  

    ```

## Verilog Operator Precedence

In Verilog, operators follow a specific order of precedence. This determines how expressions are evaluated when there are multiple operators in the same expression. Below is the list of operators in order of precedence, from highest to lowest:

1. **Unary operators**
   - `+`, `-` (unary plus and minus)
   - `!` (logical NOT)
   - `~` (bitwise NOT)
   - `&`, `~&` (reduction AND, NAND)
   - `|`, `~|` (reduction OR, NOR)
   - `^`, `~^`, `^~` (reduction XOR, XNOR)
  
2. **Multiplicative operators**
   - `*`, `/`, `%` (multiply, divide, modulus)

3. **Additive operators**
   - `+`, `-` (addition, subtraction)

4. [**Shift operators**](#shifts)
   - `<<`, `>>` (logical shift left, right)

5. **Relational operators**
   - `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=` (less than, less than or equal, greater than, greater than or equal)

6. **Equality operators**
   - `==`, `!=` (logical equality, inequality)
   - `===`, `!==` (case equality, case inequality)

7. **Bitwise operators**
   - `&`, `|`, `^`, `^~`, `~^` (AND, OR, XOR, XNOR)

8. **Logical operators**
   - `&&` (logical AND)
   - `||` (logical OR)

9. **Conditional operator**
   - `? :` (ternary operator)

10. **Assignment operators**
    - `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`, `<<=`, `>>=`, `&=`, `|=`, `^=` (assignment and compound assignments)


## Shifts

In Verilog, shift operations move bits of a value to the left or right. There are two types: **logical shifts** and **arithmetic shifts**.

### 1. Logical Shifts

Logical shifts move bits and fill the vacated positions with zeros.

**a. Logical Left Shift (`<<`)**
Shifts bits to the left by the specified amount, inserting zeros on the right. This is equivalent to multiplying by a power of 2.

**Syntax:**
```verilog
result = value << shift_amount;
```

**Example:**
```verilog
wire [3:0] value = 4'b1010; 
assign result = value << 1;  // Result: 0100
```

**b. Logical Right Shift (`>>`)**
Shifts bits to the right, inserting zeros on the left.

**Syntax:**
```verilog
result = value >> shift_amount;
```

**Example:**
```verilog
wire [3:0] value = 4'b1010;
assign result = value >> 1;  // Result: 0101
```

### 2. Arithmetic Shifts

Arithmetic shifts preserve the sign of signed numbers when shifting right.

**a. Arithmetic Right Shift (`>>>`)**
Shifts bits to the right, preserving the sign by filling the leftmost bits with the sign bit (MSB).

**Syntax:**
```verilog
result = value >>> shift_amount;
```

**Example:**
```verilog
wire signed [3:0] value = -4;  // Binary: 1100 (two's complement)
assign result = value >>> 1;   // Result: 1110
```

## Functions and Tasks

| **Time Control**           | **No timing control** (`#`, `@`, `wait` not allowed).| **Supports timing control** (can use `#`, `@`, `wait`). |
| **Arguments**              | **Only `input` arguments**.                        | Can have `input`, `output`, and `inout` arguments. |
| **Usage**                  | Used in expressions directly.                      | Called as a separate statement.                   |
| **Execution Time**         | Executes in **zero simulation time**.               | Takes **simulation time** to execute.             |
| **Use Case**               | Simple, combinational calculations.                 | Complex tasks with delays or multiple outputs.     |

### Example Function:
```verilog
function [3:0] add;
  input [3:0] a, b;
  begin
    add = a + b;
  end
endfunction
```

### Example Task:
```verilog
task add_sub;
  input [3:0] a, b;
  output [3:0] sum, diff;
  begin
    sum = a + b;
    diff = a - b;
  end
endtask
```

### Example Task (With Event Control):
```verilog
task event_control_example;
  input [3:0] a, b;
  output reg [3:0] result;
  begin
    wait (a == b);   // Wait until a equals b
    result = a + b;  // Perform addition
  end
endtask
```

### Example Task (with `output` and `inout` Arguments Called as a Separate Statement):
```verilog
module task_example;
  reg [3:0] x, y, z, sum_result, diff_result;

  initial begin
    x = 4'b1010;              // Assign some values
    y = 4'b0110;
    z = 4'b0011;

    // Call the task as a separate statement
    arithmetic_operations(x, y, sum_result, z);  // `z` will be modified in-place as an inout
  end
endmodule

task arithmetic_operations;
  input [3:0] a, b;           // Input arguments
  output reg [3:0] sum;       // Output argument
  inout [3:0] diff;           // Inout argument
  begin
    sum = a + b;              // Perform addition
    diff = diff - a;          // Modify the inout value
  end
endtask
```

## Sequential and Combinational Assignments

- **Sequential = Procedural:** Sequential logic updates state based on clock edges and uses procedural assignments, typically with **non-blocking (`<=`) assignments**. It is modeled inside `always` blocks that are sensitive to clock edges (e.g., `posedge clk`). This describes systems like flip-flops or registers that rely on previous states.

  **Example:**
  ```verilog
  always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
      if (reset)
          q <= 0;      // Asynchronous reset
      else
          q <= d;      // Update q with d at clock edge
  end
  ```

- **Combinational = Continuous:** Combinational logic depends purely on the current inputs and is described using **continuous (blocking) assignments**. It models circuits like AND, OR gates, where output is updated as soon as inputs change, without regard to clock cycles.

    **Example:**
    ```verilog
    assign y = a & b;  // Output y changes immediately based on a and b
    ```

### Relevant Constructs

- **`always` blocks:** Used to describe both sequential and combinational logic. For sequential logic, `always @(posedge clk)` or `always @(negedge clk)` is used, whereas for combinational logic, `always @(*)` is used to capture all input changes automatically.
    **Example:**
    ```verilog
    always @(*) begin
        result = a | b;  // Combinational logic triggered by any input change
    end
    ```

- **`initial` blocks:** Used to define initial conditions in simulations. They execute once at the start of the simulation and are commonly used for testbenches or initializing registers/variables in simulation but are not synthesized into hardware.
    **Example**
    ```verilog
    initial begin
        reg_x = 0;  // Initialize reg_x to 0 at simulation start
    end
    ```

### Key Points

- **Blocking (`=`) vs. Non-blocking (`<=`):** In sequential logic (`always @(posedge clk)`), use non-blocking assignments (`<=`) to ensure parallel updates. In combinational logic, blocking assignments (`=`) can be used to execute statements sequentially.
## State Machine
A state machine is a computational model used to design both software and hardware systems. It consists of a set of states, transitions between states, and actions that occur based on inputs.

### Components

1. **States**: Defined conditions or situations the system can be in.
2. **Transitions**: Conditions that trigger a change from one state to another.
3. **Inputs**: External events or conditions that affect state transitions.
4. **Outputs**: Actions or results produced during or after a state transition.

### Types of State Machines

1. **Finite State Machine (FSM)**: Has a finite number of states and transitions between them.
   - **Deterministic FSM (DFA)**: Every state has exactly one transition for each input.
   - **Non-deterministic FSM (NFA)**: A state can have multiple transitions for the same input.

2. **Mealy Machine**: The output depends on both the current state and the input.
3. **Moore Machine**: The output depends only on the current state.

### Applications

- **Control Systems**: Used in embedded systems for managing device behavior.
- **Protocols**: Helps in defining the sequence of operations in communication protocols.
- **Game Design**: To model different game states such as playing, paused, or game over.

### Example

```verilog 
module fsm_example (
    input wire clk,        // Clock input
    input wire reset,      // Asynchronous reset signal (active high)
    input wire trigger,    // Trigger input to transition between states
    output reg out         // Output signal that depends on the current state
);

    // Define the states as an enumerated type using a 2-bit register
    typedef enum reg [1:0] {
        IDLE   = 2'b00,    // State 0: Idle state (default)
        STATE1 = 2'b01,    // State 1: Represents the first active state
        STATE2 = 2'b10     // State 2: Represents the second active state
    } state_t;

    // Current state and next state registers
    reg state_t current_state, next_state;

    // Sequential logic for state transition
    // This block updates the current state on every clock edge or reset
    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset) begin
            current_state <= IDLE;   // On reset, go to IDLE state
        end else begin
            current_state <= next_state;  // On clock, update to the next state
        end
    end

    // Combinational logic for state transition based on current state and input trigger
    always @(*) begin
        // Default next state and output values
        next_state = current_state; // Hold the current state by default
        out = 1'b0;                 // Default output is 0

        // State transition logic
        case (current_state)
            IDLE: begin
                // In IDLE, if 'trigger' is high, move to STATE1

# Simulations
## Delays in Verilog
Propagation delays in Verilog simulate the time it takes for signals to propagate through circuits.

### Delayed Assignments
In **continuous assignments**, use `#delay` to specify how long it takes for the output to update after a change in the inputs.

```verilog
 assign #5 y = a & b;  // y updates 5 time units after a or b changes 
 ```

### Why Use Delays?

- **Timing Simulation:** Models real-world signal delays.
- **Accurate Behavior:** Ensures proper timing in combinational logic.

### Delays in Procedural Assignments

Delays can also be applied in **procedural blocks** like `always`:

```verilog
 always @ (a or b) begin
    #3 out = a & b;  // out updates 3 time units after input changes
end 
```

### Inertial vs. Transport Delays

- **Inertial Delay**: This is the default type of delay in Verilog. It filters out glitches, meaning only input pulses longer than the delay propagate to the output. 
  - **Example**: If `#5` is used, pulses shorter than 5 time units will be filtered.
  
  ```verilog
  assign #5 y = a & b;  // Inertial delay, y updates only if changes persist for 5 time units 
   ```

- **Transport Delay**: This models a physical delay without filtering any input pulses. Even if an input changes rapidly, the signal is propagated to the output after the delay.
  - **Example**: Use `transport` to force transport delay behavior.

  ```verilog
  assign #5 y = transport a & b;  // Transport delay, y updates exactly 5 time units after input change 
  ```

### Key Differences:

- **Inertial delay**: Mimics real-world circuits where short glitches are filtered.
- **Transport delay**: Models pure signal propagation without glitch filtering.


## Wait Statements

In Verilog, the `wait` statement is used to pause the execution of a block until a certain condition becomes true. Unlike an `always` or `@(posedge clk)` block that waits for specific events (like clock edges), the `wait` statement halts the execution until the specified condition is met. Primarily used with delays to simulate hardware restrictions.

### **Syntax:**
```verilog
wait (condition) begin
    // Code to execute after the condition is true
end
```

### Example:
```verilog
reg signal, result;

initial begin
    result = 0;
    signal = 0;
    #10 signal = 1;  // Signal changes after 10 time units
    wait (signal == 1) begin
        result = 1;   // Result is updated after signal becomes high
    end
end
```

# Applications
## 4-bit Adder
A 4-bit adder adds two 4-bit binary numbers together, producing a 4-bit sum output along with a carry-out bit that indicates an overflow if the sum exceeds the capacity of 4 bits.

![4-bit Full Adder](pictures\4-bit_adder.png)

### Ripple Carry Adder (RCA)
```verilog
module FullAdder (A, B, Ci, Co, S);

    input A, B, Ci;    // Inputs: A, B, and Carry In (Ci)
    output S, Co;      // Outputs: Sum (S) and Carry Out (Co)

    assign S = A ^ B ^ Ci;      // Sum calculation
    assign Co = (A & B) | (B & Ci) | (A & Ci);  // Carry Out calculation

endmodule


module Adder4 (S, Co, A, B, Ci);

    input [3:0] A, B;  // 4-bit inputs
    input Ci;          // Carry input
    output [3:0] S;    // 4-bit sum output
    output Co;         // Carry out
    wire [3:1] C;      // Internal carry signals

    // Instantiate 4 Full Adders
    FullAdder FA0 (A[0], B[0], Ci, C[1], S[0]);
    FullAdder FA1 (A[1], B[1], C[1], C[2], S[1]);
    FullAdder FA2 (A[2], B[2], C[2], C[3], S[2]);
    FullAdder FA3 (A[3], B[3], C[3], Co, S[3]);

endmodule

```
### Look-Ahead Adder (CLA)
A 4-bit carry look-ahead adder (CLA) is a faster alternative to the ripple carry adder, as it calculates the carries in parallel rather than waiting for each carry to propagate through the stages sequentially. The carry look-ahead adder computes the carry signals using the generate (G) and propagate (P) functions.

```verilog
module cla_4bit (
    input [3:0] A, B,
    input Cin,
    output [3:0] Sum,
    output Cout
);
    wire [3:0] G, P;  // Generate and propagate signals
    wire C1, C2, C3;

    // Generate and propagate signals
    assign G = A & B;  // Generate
    assign P = A | B;  // Propagate

    // Carry look-ahead logic
    assign #5 C1 = G[0] | (P[0] & Cin);
    assign #5 C2 = G[1] | (P[1] & G[0]) | (P[1] & P[0] & Cin);
    assign #5 C3 = G[2] | (P[2] & G[1]) | (P[2] & P[1] & G[0]) | (P[2] & P[1] & P[0] & Cin);
    assign #5 Cout = G[3] | (P[3] & G[2]) | (P[3] & P[2] & G[1]) | (P[3] & P[2] & P[1] & G[0]) | (P[3] & P[2] & P[1] & P[0] & Cin);

    // Sum calculation
    assign #5 Sum[0] = A[0] ^ B[0] ^ Cin;
    assign #5 Sum[1] = A[1] ^ B[1] ^ C1;
    assign #5 Sum[2] = A[2] ^ B[2] ^ C2;
    assign #5 Sum[3] = A[3] ^ B[3] ^ C3;
    
endmodule
```

### Delay Comparison: Carry Look-Ahead Adder (CLA) vs. Ripple Carry Adder (RCA)

#### 1. Ripple Carry Adder (RCA)
- **Delay Growth**: Linear `O(N)` (increases with the number of bits)
- **Total Delay**: `N * Gate Delay per Full Adder`

#### 2. Carry Look-Ahead Adder (CLA)
- **Delay Growth**: Logarithmic `O(log N)` (grows slower as the number of bits increases)
- **Total Delay**: `log_2(N) * Gate Delay per Stage`

#### 3. Comparison of Delays

| Number of Bits | RCA Delay (Linear) | CLA Delay (Logarithmic) |
|----------------|--------------------|-------------------------|
| 4 bits         | 20 ns              | 20 ns                   |
| 8 bits         | 40 ns              | 15 ns                   |
| 16 bits        | 80 ns              | 20 ns                   |
| 32 bits        | 160 ns             | 25 ns                   |

## 4-to-1 Mux
A 4-to-1 multiplexer selects one of four input signals based on a 2-bit selection input and forwards the selected input to the output.

![4-to-1 Mux](pictures\Multiplexer-Block-Diagram.png)

```verilog
module Mux4to1 (
    input wire I0, I1, I2, I3,  // 4 data inputs
    input wire S0, S1,          // 2 select lines
    output wire Y               // Output
);

assign Y = (~S1 & ~S0 & I0) |  // Select I0 when S1 = 0, S0 = 0
           (~S1 &  S0 & I1) |  // Select I1 when S1 = 0, S0 = 1
           ( S1 & ~S0 & I2) |  // Select I2 when S1 = 1, S0 = 0
           ( S1 &  S0 & I3);   // Select I3 when S1 = 1, S0 = 1

endmodule

```

## Shift Register
### 4-bit Left Shift 
A 4-bit left shift register shifts the contents of the register one bit to the left on each clock cycle, with a new bit introduced at the least significant bit (LSB) and the most significant bit (MSB) being discarded.

![Left Shift Register](pictures\Shift-Left-Registers.jpg)

```verilog
module LeftShiftRegister (
    input wire clk,           // Clock input
    input wire reset,         // Reset input
    input wire D_in,          // Serial data input
    output reg [3:0] Q        // 4-bit parallel output
);

// On the positive edge of the clock, perform the left shift
always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
    if (reset) begin
        Q <= 4'b0000;         // Reset all outputs to 0
    end else begin
        Q <= {Q[2:0], D_in};  // Shift left and input new data bit on Q0
    end
end

endmodule
```

### 8-bit Left Shift
```verilog
module shift_register_8bit (
    input wire SI,     // Serial input
    input wire Clk,    // Clock signal (rising edge)
    input wire EN,     // Enable (active high)
    output reg SO      // Serial output
);

    // Internal 8-bit register to hold the shift data
    reg [7:0] shift_reg;

    // Always block triggered on rising edge of clock
    always @(posedge Clk) begin
        if (EN) begin
            // Shift register: shift in SI and shift out MSB (SO)
            SO <= shift_reg[7];      // MSB is shifted out
            shift_reg <= {shift_reg[6:0], SI};  // Shift left and input SI
        end
    end

endmodule
```

## 8-bit Counter (Lab 3)
Lab simulation: [3-Bit Up/Down counter with a clear and load.](https://circuitverse.org/users/183511/projects/3-bit-up-down-counter-d9e9961a-4eb6-40fb-abcf-097fc7e38dac)

This lab involves designing an 8-bit up/down counter using Verilog, implemented on the NEXYS-4 FPGA board. A Vivado project is provided for this example.

The **CD74HC190/191** and **CD54HC190/191** are highly versatile presettable up/down counters commonly used in digital electronics for tasks requiring accurate counting, such as digital clocks, timers, and frequency dividers. These ICs can be configured to count in either **binary** (CD74HC191) or **BCD (Binary-Coded Decimal)** format (CD74HC190), and support synchronous counting with a variety of control options, including asynchronous presetting, counting direction control, and enabling inputs. With additional outputs like ripple carry and terminal count, these counters are ideal for cascading multiple units to create larger counting systems.

In **Lab 3**, we implemented an 8-bit up/down counter based on the functionality of the 74HC190/191 but directly in Verilog, bypassing the need for discrete hardware. This allowed us to overcome common design challenges such as signal ripple effects and cascading hazards that typically occur when connecting multiple 4-bit counters. By using Verilog, we streamlined the design, implementing advanced features such as **parallel loading**, which enables the counter to start from a user-defined value, and a clock control to slow down the counting process for easier observation.

### Identifying Required Number of bits
To determine how many bits are needed to count to a specific number \(N\), use the following steps:

1. Use the formula: `n = log2(N)` where `n` is the number of bits.
2. Round up the result to the nearest whole number.
3. A counter with `n` bits can represent numbers from `0` to `2^n - 1`, which must be greater than or equal to \(N\).

### Example:
To count up to 100:

1. `n = log2(100)` ≈ 6.64
2. Round up to 7.

You would need **7 bits** to count up to 100, as 7 bits can represent values from 0 to 127.

### Parallel Loading

**Parallel loading** allows a counter to load a preset value into all its flip-flops simultaneously in a single clock cycle. By using input lines (like A-D or D0-D3) and a load signal, the counter can instantly update its value upon the next clock cycle, bypassing the need for sequential counting. This is particularly useful for initializing the counter or synchronizing multiple counters efficiently. In this lab, we used parallel loading to preset the 8-bit counter with values determined by the input switches, adding greater flexibility to the counting process.


## Synchronous 4-bit Up/Down Counter (74HC192)
```Verilog

module counter_74HC192 (
    input wire Clr,      // Clear the counter
    input wire Load,     // Load the counter with a value
    input wire Up,       // Count up when asserted
    input wire Down,     // Count down when asserted
    input wire [3:0] P,  // Data input for loading preset
    input wire Clk,      // Clock input
    output reg [3:0] Q   // 4-bit counter output
);

// Always block, sensitive to Clk, Clr, Load, Up, Down
always @(posedge Clk or posedge Clr or posedge Load) begin
    if (Clr) begin
        Q <= 4'b0000;  // Clear the counter
    end
    else if (Load) begin
        Q <= D;  // Load the counter with input value
    end
    else if (Up && !Down) begin
        Q <= Q + 1;  // Increment counter
    end
    else if (Down && !Up) begin
        Q <= Q - 1;  // Decrement counter
    end
end

endmodule
```
## SR Latch
![SR Latch](pictures\sr_latch.png)

### SR Latch Using a Boolean Equation
```verilog 

module sr_latch_boolean (
    input wire S,   // Set input
    input wire R,   // Reset input
    output reg Q,   // Output
    output reg Qn   // Inverted output
);

    always @(*) begin
        if (S && !R) begin
            Q <= 1;   // Set
            Qn <= 0;
        end
        else if (!S && R) begin
            Q <= 0;   // Reset
            Qn <= 1;
        end
        // If S == 0 and R == 0, Q and Qn retain previous state (no action)
    end

endmodule
```

### SR Latch Using Gate-Level Description
```verilog

module sr_latch_gate_level (
    input wire S,   // Set input
    input wire R,   // Reset input
    output wire Q,  // Output
    output wire Qn  // Inverted output
);

    wire nand1_out, nand2_out;

    // NAND gates for SR Latch
    nand (nand1_out, S, Qn);  // First NAND gate
    nand (nand2_out, R, Q);   // Second NAND gate

    assign Q = nand1_out;
    assign Qn = nand2_out;

endmodule
```

## 4-bit Comparator

A **4-bit comparator** is a digital circuit that compares two 4-bit binary numbers and outputs the result of their comparison. It determines whether one number is greater than, less than, or equal to the other.

### Inputs
- **A[3:0]**: 4-bit binary number (A3, A2, A1, A0)
- **B[3:0]**: 4-bit binary number (B3, B2, B1, B0)

### Outputs
- **A > B**: Output is 1 if the binary number A is greater than B.
- **A < B**: Output is 1 if the binary number A is less than B.
- **A = B**: Output is 1 if the binary number A is equal to B.

### Logic for Comparison
To compare two 4-bit numbers, the comparison starts from the most significant bit (MSB) down to the least significant bit (LSB):

1. **A > B**:
   - If A3 > B3, then A > B regardless of the lower bits.
   - If A3 = B3, move to compare A2 and B2.
   - Repeat for all bits until a difference is found or A = B.

2. **A < B**:
   - If A3 < B3, then A < B.
   - If A3 = B3, move to compare A2 and B2.
   - Continue this until a difference is found or A = B.

3. **A = B**:
   - If all bits (A3 to A0) are equal to their corresponding B bits, then A = B.

### Truth Table

| A3 | A2 | A1 | A0 | B3 | B2 | B1 | B0 | A > B | A < B | A = B |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|-------|-------|-------|
|  0 |  0 |  0 |  1 |  0 |  0 |  0 |  1 |   0   |   0   |   1   |
|  1 |  0 |  1 |  0 |  0 |  1 |  1 |  0 |   1   |   0   |   0   |
|  0 |  1 |  1 |  1 |  1 |  0 |  0 |  1 |   0   |   1   |   0   |
| ...| ...| ...| ...| ...| ...| ...| ...|  ...  |  ...  |  ...  |

### Verilog Implementation
A simple implementation in Verilog:

```verilog
module Comparator4bit(
    input [3:0] A, B,
    output A_greater, A_less, A_equal
);

assign A_greater = (A > B);
assign A_less = (A < B);
assign A_equal = (A == B);

endmodule
```

# To do
1. Bypass capacitors required in FPGAs
2. Division, except by powers of 2 is not supported in Vivado
3. If you use an if statement, but don’t have an else, the synthesizer may create a latch you did not expect.
4. Synthesis vs implementation
